# CRUDApplication

This repository provides a starter project for a CRUD application using Spring Boot, RestControllers, and H2 for an in memory database. When using the H2 console in the browser (eg: `localhost:8080/console`) be sure to set the `JDBC URL` to match the url defined in `application-h2.properties`. The default is `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`.

## Exercise

Using this project as a starter, create a Person class as an entity to persist to H2 with an autogenerated id. Provide a RestController for Person with endpoints for HTTP GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations mapping to their appropriate CRUD behaviors. Endpoints should be at `/person` and `/person/{id}` as appropriate and provide the correct HTTP status codes in the response. See the snippet below for setting Person IDs:

```Java
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Integer id;
    ...
}
```
